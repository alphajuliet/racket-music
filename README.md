# racket-music

Explorations in musical theory and manipulation using Racket, and the associated
`rsound` package. Support from my functional library `rakeda`.

This contains a bunch of utilities focused on lists of integers modulo 12 (notes in an octave)
and note names. We also create named chords, and define some Neo-Riemannian transforms.

This is very much a work in progress.
